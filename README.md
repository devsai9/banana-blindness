# Banana Blindness

## What is it?
Banana Blindness is a Python program that uses hand gestures and movements to control the user's laptop. It is meant for a better hands-free experience, such as when you're watching content and you do not want to touch your keyboard.

## How is it made?
The Banana Blindness program runs on Python and uses OpenCV to detect the user's hand with AI and decipher hand gestures. MediaPipe hand landmarks detection is combined with local formulas in order to make gestures translate to live changes on the screen. Our website runs on Next.JS and is styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Available Hand Gestures
Here is a list of the available hand gestures:
- Pinch your pointer/index finger to move your cursor on the screen (Picture 1)<br>
- Tap your index finger and thumb for left click (Picture 2)<br>
- Ball your hand into a thumbs-up and turn it left 90 degrees to rewind video by 5 seconds (Picture 4)<br>
- Ball your hand into a thumbs-up and turn it right 90 degrees to forward video by 5 seconds (Picture 3)<br>
- Tap your index finder and thumb, keep them closed, and move your hand up and down to scroll!<br>
